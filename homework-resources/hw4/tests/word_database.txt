This
is
a
database
of
words
for
the
CS104
assignment
that
recreates
twitter
If
you
want
to
add
more
words
you
can
enter
any
text
here
to
get
a
series
of
randomly
generated
tweets
The
grading
script
will
use
this
text
file
and
pick
a
series
of
random
words
and
place
them
in
sentences
There
is
no
guarantee
that
the
generated
tweets
are
going
to
make
any
sense
at
all
because
of
the
strange
nature
of
stringing
words
together
in
some
random
order
but
it
should
make
for
a
good
test
for
making
sure
students
code
works
well
with
a
large
input
