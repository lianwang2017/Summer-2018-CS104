1. a data type that stores the college that won the NCAA basketball 
   championship each year, in the order they won (i.e. year). You do not need to store the year.

2. a data type that would store the SSN of those who have registered to 
   vote. We want to ensure no one can register to vote twice so we would want to do efficient lookups to see if a given SSN is already present.

3. a data type that stores all of the 2-letter state postal codes (e.g.
   "CA", "NV", "NY", etc.) and all the zip codes that exist in that particular state. We should be able to quickly determine if, for a given state, a zip code really does exist in that state.

4. a data type that stores a the list of recently visited websites 
   (stores the URLs) for each user on a computer

5. a data type to store the configuration of a 10x12 maze (where the
   walls vs. free spaces are)
